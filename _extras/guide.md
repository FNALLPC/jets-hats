This instructure notes are providing information for the instructures of the DASJan2024 and beyond.

## Setup

This version uses the packages in the cvmfs environment `LCG_103`: `/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_103/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/setup.sh` 
In principle, it should work in any computer that has access to cvmfs. 

## Input Files

The nanoAOD files used in the notebooks were copied to the LPC CMSDAS are and are under: `/store/user/cmsdas/2023/short_exercises/jets/`. 
In principle they need any nanoAOD file for QCD, TTjets, WjetsToQQ and RSGluon.

Currently it uses the TTJets jmenanoAOD to access calojets. 

## Files for CMSSW

The repository contains the old files to run inside CMSSW, and therefore the folder structure
follows that paradigm. In the current version of this notes, the c++ and python files are there for
students to look at them if needed. They are not used in the context of the class.

## Old google slides
