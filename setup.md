title: Setup
---


The current version of this tutorial has been tested in the [Purdue Analysis Facility](https://analysis-facility.physics.purdue.edu/en/latest/index.html) (AF). Please follow the next steps to set up all you need.

# Run exercises at Purdue AF

Please follow [these steps to create your account](https://analysis-facility.physics.purdue.edu/en/latest/doc-getting-started.html). In short, if you have a fnal/cern account follow the link to log in into the Purdue AF: [https://cms.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu/hub](https://cms.geddes.rcac.purdue.edu/hub). Choose between your CERN/FNAL/Purdue account and follow the instructions to log in.  

Once you logged in into the jupyterhub, it will ask you for the server options. Choose the **default options** and click on start. After a couple of minutes your session will be ready to start and you will see a jupyter notebook environment.

Now you need to clone the [jets-hats](https://github.com/FNALLPC/jets-hats) repository. For that you can go to the menu `Git > Clone a repository`. A small window will pop up and you can fill `Enter the URI of the remote Git repository` with the following url: [https://github.com/FNALLPC/jets-hats](https://github.com/FNALLPC/jets-hats). Click on `Clone` and you should be ready to go.


## Purdue Analysis Facility

Before the live session, please make sure that you can access Purdue Analysis Facility using the instructions below. In case of any questions/issues please post on the Mattermost channel.

 * Navigate to the [Purdue AF](https://analysis-facility.physics.purdue.edu/) website and click “Login to Purdue Analysis Facility”.
 *  On the CILogon page, choose CERN account to log in (using Fermilab or Purdue credentials is also possible).
 *  You will be redirected to the “Server Options” page. The default resource selection (4 CPUs, 16 GB RAM) is enough for the HATS exercises, but you can select more resources if needed. Do not add GPUs to your session – there are not enough GPUs for all participants.
 *  Click “Start” to create your Analysis Facility session. It may take a couple of minutes to load.
 *  Done! Your session is ready.

### Additional info

 * As a CMS member, you can continue using Purdue AF for your work after HATS is over.
 * Your Purdue AF session will keep running even if you close your web browser tab, so you can reconnect to it at any time. Idle sessions are terminated after 14 days.
 * When you log in for the first time, we create a 25 GB private directory for you at /home/<username>, and a shared /work/users/<username> directory with 100 GB quota. These directories will persist for 6 months after your last activity at Purdue AF.
 * Browse the [documentation](https://analysis-facility.physics.purdue.edu/) to learn more about available functionality.



# Run exercises at the CMS-LPC

**If the instructions above do not work, you can follow this instructions.**


Open a terminal/console, connect to cmslpc-sl7 and prepare your working area:

~~~
kinit username@FNAL.GOV
ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 <YOUR USERNAME>@cmslpc-sl7.fnal.gov
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you haven't done it yet, go to your `nobackup` area (`/uscms_data/d3/<YOUR USERNAME>/`) and create a folder for the CMSDAS exercises. Once you are there you can clone our repository:

~~~
git clone git@github.com:cms-jet/JMEDAS.git -b DASJan2024
cd JMEDAS/notebooks/DAS/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Remember
> Once you clone the repository, using the `DASJan2024` branch, the exercise notebooks are located
> in `JMEDAS/notebooks/DAS/`
{: .callout}

Activate your grid certificate:
~~~
voms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:00
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The following commands one has to do it *everytime you log in into a new session*. They load the
environment and the packages needed for the exercises and open a jupyter notebook:
~~~
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_104/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888 --ip 127.0.0.1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If these two lines are running sucessfully, you should see something like this:
~~~
[I 11:09:47.019 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /uscms_data/d3/user/CMSDAS/ShortExJets2024/JMEDAS/notebooks/master
[I 11:09:47.019 NotebookApp] Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0 is running at:
[I 11:09:47.019 NotebookApp] http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=7b7fed77cb9d6b3b18708b86bgfdsgsd069c6bc8ce0a9abad2
[I 11:09:47.019 NotebookApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=7b7fed77cb9d6b3b18708b86bgfdsgsd069c6bc8ce0a9abad2
[I 11:09:47.019 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 11:09:47.028 NotebookApp]

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///uscms/homes/u/user/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-10677-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=7b7fed77cb9d6b3b18708b86bgfdsgsd069c6bc8ce0a9abad2
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=7b7fed77cb9d6b3b18708b86bgfdsgsd069c6bc8ce0a9abad2

~~~
{: .output}

Copy and paste one of the last two urls in your favorite browser and now you can continue with the lesson 1 (Episode 1).


> ## If you are using PUTTY
> Go to ssh tab on the left then type in source port (ex. 8888) with destination (ex. localhost:8888) and then hit "add" to add this to the list of ports
> If 8888 is occupied, use another port (ex. anything above 8000) instead
{: .callout}




## Useful settings

If you like seeing your working directory in the commandline, you can do also this by adding a line to ~/.bashrc and activating it with the 'source' command:

~~~
echo "PS1='\W\$ '" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
~~~
{: .language-bash}
