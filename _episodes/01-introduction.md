## Jet Basics

For the first part of this introduction open the notebook called `Basics.ipynb`.

This preliminary exercise will illustrate some of the basic properties of jets in CMS. We will use nanoAOD files. For more information about nanoAOD follow [this link](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-nanoAOD/nanoaod-doc/-/wikis/home).

> ## Question 1.1
