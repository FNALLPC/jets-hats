    "Jets are reconstructed physics objects representing the hadronization and fragmentation of quarks and gluons. CMS mostly uses anti-$k_{\\mathrm{T}}$ jets with a cone-size of $R=0.4$ to reconstruct this type of jet. We have algorithms that distinguish heavy-flavour (b or c) quarks (which are in the domain of the BTV POG), quark- vs gluon-originated jets, and jets from the main $pp$ collision versus jets formed largely from pileup particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, quarks and gluons are only part of the story! At the LHC, the typical collision energy is much greater than the mass scale of the known SM particles, and hence even heavier particles like top quarks, W/Z/Higgs bosons, and heavy beyond-the-Standard-Model particles can be produced with large Lorentz boosts. When these particles decay to quarks and gluons, their decay products are collimated and overlap in the detector, making them difficult to reconstruct as individual AK4 jets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, LHC analyses use jet algorithms with a large radius parameter to reconstruct these objects, which we called \"large radius\" or \"fat\" jets. CMS uses anti-$k_{\\mathrm{T}}$ jets with $R=0.8$ (AK8) as the standard large-radius jet, while ATLAS uses AK10. \n",

These algorithms are included in the centrally produced CMS samples, at the AOD, miniAOD, and nanoAOD data tiers (note that miniAOD and nanoAOD are most commonly used for analysis, while AOD is much less common these days, and is not widely available on the grid).
