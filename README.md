## CMSDAS Jet Short Exercise - January  2024
  
### Introduction
This tutorial is intended to provide you with the basic you need in order to deal with jets in your analysis. We start with the basics of what is a jet, how are they reconstructed, what algorithms are used, etc. Then we give examples with scripts on how to access jets and use them in your analysis frameworks, including corrections and systematics. In the second part of the exercise, we examine jet substructure algorithms, which have many uses including identification of hadronic decays of heavy SM particles like top quarks, W, Z, and H bosons, as well as mitigation of pileup and others.

The tutorial is designed to be executed at cmslpc and followed in the [JMEDAS 2024 website](http://cms-jet.github.io/JMEDAS), where you find links to instructional slides and instructions that walk you through the exercises.
